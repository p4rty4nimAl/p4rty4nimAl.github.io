      I laid still, in a field of grass,<br />
      The curve of a lifetime forgotten,<br />
      Traceable,<br />
      <br />
      The grass of a thousand lives before me,<br />
      Each identical under the gaze of the masses,<br />
      Each with such story,<br />
      Such individuality,<br />
      <br />
      A tree stands, squats: the horizon calls,<br />
      You ignore it,<br />
      <br />
      As you distance, trees disappear,<br />
      Forests give way to cities;<br />
      Give way to the trap,<br />
      <br />
      Hundreds of trees stand, still,<br />
      Surrounded by smoke and steel,<br />
      A breath of fresh air no more than a myth,<br />
      <br />
      I lay once again in this former field,<br />
      <br />
      You see me, silently approach;<br />
      I think: I know your words;<br />
      But you just walk away,<br />
      Once more.
