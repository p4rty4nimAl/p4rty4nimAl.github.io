      A ray of hope, caught in a razor,<br />
      what's next is anyone's guess,<br />
      <br />
      A sharp line of skin,<br />
      A slicing, stinging, burning pain,<br />
      and the past comes rushing back.<br />
      <br />
      Rushing, like the veins,<br />
      like the arteries,<br />
      which don't suffer thought:<br />
      saying, "You are Nothing without me"<br />
      <br />
      They are not alone in their message,<br />
      Echoed by scars,<br />
      Repeated by the scales,<br />
      A prisoner turned against its sole possesor.<br />
