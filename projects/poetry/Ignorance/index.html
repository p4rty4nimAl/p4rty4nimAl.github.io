      I laid still, in a field of grass,
      The curve of a lifetime forgotten,
      Traceable,
      
      The grass of a thousand lives before me,
      Each identical under the gaze of the masses,
      Each with such story,
      Such individuality,
      
      A tree stands, squats: the horizon calls,
      You ignore it,
      
      As you distance, trees disappear,
      Forests give way to cities;
      Give way to the trap,
      
      Hundreds of trees stand, still,
      Surrounded by smoke and steel,
      A breath of fresh air no more than a myth,
      
      I lay once again in this former field,
      
      You see me, silently approach;
      I think: I know your words;
      But you just walk away,
      Once more.
